## XRR-MDN
X-ray reflectivity(XRR) data analysis using mixture density network (MDN).

This code is made for the probabilitistic parameter estimation using MDN for the XRR data.
Attatched file contains XRR data measured at 11keV for Pt/Co/Pt multilayer system(11keV_3nm.txt), python script(XRRMachinTools.py), and jupyter notebook(TrainMachin.ipynb).
All code is written in a object oriented way so that you can easily try the example analysis with jupyter notebook.
You can use or modify the code freely.
Non-commercial purpose only.
